This mod is pretty simple but in my opinion very usefull and it consist on a simple led strim on a holder in the top V slot .  
for this upgrade you will need:
- a simple [5v led strip](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005003256544536.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.59.f1071f28IAlHd1&algo_pvid=e7017ac9-ba82-400a-bed5-f9b8f2e79fe4&algo_exp_id=e7017ac9-ba82-400a-bed5-f9b8f2e79fe4-29&pdp_npi=3%40dis%21EUR%213.05%210.49%21%21%21%21%21%402145294416844258729002365d07a9%2112000029510780747%21sea%21FR%210&curPageLogUid=RLkDm09aMjhp)it's 3€ for 1 meter (i power it from the bl touch port)*note:you can also power it from the psu witch 24V leds*
