This mod is pretty simple but in my opinion very usefull and it consist on a simple led strim on a holder in the top V slot .  
for this upgrade you will need:
- a simple 5v led strip (i power it from the bl touch port)*note:you can also power it from the psu witch 24V leds*
- 2printed parts
- some wire
- A switch (I have choose a simple round one to make integration easier)
- maybe a connector if you want a cleaner instalation than mine x)
