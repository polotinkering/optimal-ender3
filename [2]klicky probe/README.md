i have recently integrated the kevinakasam klack ender probe 

it's a very good adition to the solid silicon plots since it correct the warping of the bed and it's very cheap:  

you only need 6 magnets 4 screws and a microswitch .  

I will not do the complete guide here but if you want to try it here is the [klack ender github](https://github.com/kevinakasam/KlackEnder-Probe)
