i have recently integrated the kevinakasam klack ender probe 

it's a very good adition to the solid silicon plots since it correct the warping of the bed and it's very cheap:  
you only need 6 magnets 4 screws and a microswitch .
I will not do the complete guide here but if you want to try it here is the [klack ender github]https://github.com/kevinakasam/KlackEnder-Probe
