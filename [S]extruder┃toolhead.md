this mod will cost you :
- about 15â‚¬ for [this very cheap knock off](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005003423850142.html?spm=a2g0o.detail.100009.2.2af23f3e9CdaJw&gps-id=pcDetailLeftTopSell&scm=1007.13482.271138.0&scm_id=1007.13482.271138.0&scm-url=1007.13482.271138.0&pvid=72d04b6e-3c4b-4f22-9e2e-47e98820322d&_t=gps-id%3ApcDetailLeftTopSell%2Cscm-url%3A1007.13482.271138.0%2Cpvid%3A72d04b6e-3c4b-4f22-9e2e-47e98820322d%2Ctpp_buckets%3A668%232846%238113%231998&pdp_npi=3%40dis%21EUR%2116.72%216.2%21%21%21%21%21%40211b801516843168637262553ef395%2112000025721494267%21rec%21FR%21&gatewayAdapt=glo2fra)
- 30â‚¬ for [this good quality clone](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005003092239261.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.17.4f797f71teUpbM&algo_pvid=a6f849b8-87f4-4deb-97c4-12fc0ebfa4d4&algo_exp_id=a6f849b8-87f4-4deb-97c4-12fc0ebfa4d4-8&pdp_npi=3%40dis%21EUR%2145.55%2130.16%21%21%21%21%21%402100ba4716843171096598967d074c%2112000024944119914%21sea%21FR%210&curPageLogUid=TxhYbl9whPqE)
- aproximately 100â‚¬ for [the original bontech](https://www.3djake.fr/bondtech/extruder-bmg-droit) depending from were you order

this mod is verry usefull and it will last you longer than the plastic one .

optionaly you can also like me upgrade later on the voron afterburner and there is many reason why you would want to do that :
- print easily flexibles materials like TPU .
- do maintenance much more easily because it is very convenient to dissassemble .
- swap from one hot end to another realy quickly .

- have a much more slylish printer ðŸ˜Ž.
