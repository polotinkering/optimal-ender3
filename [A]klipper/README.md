Klipper
---
What an interesting modification !  
some will be surpised that i don't put it on [S] tier but i feel like you can have some realy good results with the classic marlin firmware or [this custom firmware](https://youtu.be/y_RQnFo1w_Y) based on marlin.
I want to adress a big thanks to [JSTECH](https://www.youtube.com/@Jstech3d) and all of his discord for the support and the help while setting up the custom firmware and after klipper .
