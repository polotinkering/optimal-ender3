Voron afterbuner
---
one of the best upgrades i have done until now
this is why you would want to switch to afterbuner :
- print easily flexibles materials like TPU .
- do maintenance much more easily because it is very convenient to dissassemble .
- swap from one hot end to another realy quickly .
- have a much more slylish printer ðŸ˜Ž.

I have reused the gear from my dual gear extruder seen above.  
it have worked perfectly great since the biggining and after swapping to a mosquito knock off i don't have any trouble when printing hight temp material like ABS or PETG.
And if you have a voron you can have a common stock of spare printed parts wich is realy convinient if you have a problem on one of your printers .  
Big thanks to the voron team for developping this toolhead !
